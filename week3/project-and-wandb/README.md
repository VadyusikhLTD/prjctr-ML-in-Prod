# Purpose

This is a part of homework to practice with WandB. 
To test WandB I've selected simple image classification task - Fashion MNIST.  
As a reference for some solution (argument processing, usage Python Data classes) was selected [text-classification pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/text-classification).

# Image classification

Dataset - Fashion MNIST.
